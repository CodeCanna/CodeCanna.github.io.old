            I'm passionate about games.  I have been playing games since I was a kid, started with Spyro the Dragon, and Crash Bandicoot.
            Games are literally a mixture of all the arts, and sciences rolled into one.  Think about it, you have physics simulations, graphical art, music, stories, programming, UI design, puzzle design, and plenty more that I can't even think
            of.
            Anything imaginable can be made into a video game, because video games are a work of fiction and some works of fact, like an interactive book or movie.  So much time and money goes into making a good game, and sometimes you get
            amazing concepts come to life.
            In my opinion games are the ultimate form of entertainment today, because is is ALL of the arts, and Sciences rolled up into one.
