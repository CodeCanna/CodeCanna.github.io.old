        <h1 id="Tips-and-tricks-for-Windows-refugees"><a href="#Tips-and-tricks-for-Windows-refugees" class="headerlink" title="Tips and tricks for Windows refugees"></a>Tips and tricks for Windows refugees</h1><p>Those of us who have been Linuxers for a while now can look back on the old days that we spent using windows thinking that Windows was the only OS besides MAC.  Then we discovered that in fact, its quite the opposite.  There are way more Linux distributions than there are Windows version and MAC version combined, and they all have their ups and downs.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Windows and Linux, but there are also many similarities.  We will discuss the main differences and similarities and why you might want to come over to the Tux side.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Linux"><a href="#What-is-Linux" class="headerlink" title="What is Linux?"></a>What is Linux?</h1><p>So if you have read this far then you know that there is more operating systems than just Windows and MAC.  You have discovered the rapidly growing world of open source software.  Linux is an open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel" target="_blank" rel="external">operating system kernel</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" rel="external">Linus Torvolds</a> in the 1990s and he actually wasn’t expecting how it would change the world as most of the internet runs on his kernel.  Most website servers use Linux for web-hosting but it wasn’t until recently around 2005 that Linux started “going mainstream”.  Now most Linux distributions come with a full software arsenal for office, web searching, email, and most recently games.</p>
<h1 id="Main-differences-between-Windows-and-Linux"><a href="#Main-differences-between-Windows-and-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Main differences between Windows and Linux"></a>Main differences between Windows and Linux</h1><ul>
<li>Linux is free windows is not.</li>
<li>Windows requires and anti-virus Linux does not.</li>
<li>Window’s source code is closed Linuxe’s source code is open.</li>
<li>Linux can’t run Windows software out of the box.</li>
<li>Windows was more user friendly but that has changed in the past years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux requires a learning curve to get used to, but once you know the basics you will see how versatile and fast Linux can be.</p>
<h1 id="Main-similarities-between-Windows-and-Linux"><a href="#Main-similarities-between-Windows-and-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Main similarities between Windows and Linux"></a>Main similarities between Windows and Linux</h1><ul>
<li>They are both internet capable</li>
<li>Linux has a Desktop Environment like Windows (It just looks different.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how the similarities list is very short.  That is because they are actually very different under the hood.</p>
<h1 id="What-should-I-know-coming-from-Windows"><a href="#What-should-I-know-coming-from-Windows" class="headerlink" title="What should I know coming from Windows?"></a>What should I know coming from Windows?</h1><h2 id="The-package-manager"><a href="#The-package-manager" class="headerlink" title="The package manager"></a>The package manager</h2><p>People switching from Windows should become familiar with the concept of not going to the internet to download all of their software.  All Linux distros come with a <strong>Package Manager</strong>.  A package manager is pretty much like an apps store, it is where you will get most of your software.  You have to get out of the habit of going to a third party website and downloading <strong>“.exe”</strong> files.  This is a good thing and a bad thing.  The good thing is the you can rest assured that the software in your package manager is safe.  For this and other reasons Linux doesn’t really need an anti-virus program.</p>
<h2 id="The-Terminal-dun-dun-duuuunnnnn"><a href="#The-Terminal-dun-dun-duuuunnnnn" class="headerlink" title="The Terminal (dun dun duuuunnnnn!!)"></a>The Terminal (dun dun duuuunnnnn!!)</h2><p><img src="images/terminal.png" alt="Terminal_Img"><br>The Terminal, the bane of Linux beginners.  The terminal is the same as the CMD in Windows.  For those who don’t know the Terminal/CMD is that scary black screen with the blinking cursor that “computer geniuses” use to give commands directly to the computer.  If your going to use Linux I urge you to become at least familiar with the basics of this powerful tool.  But with today’s user friendly disrtos that is not necessary just recommended.</p>
<h2 id="The-Linux-kernel"><a href="#The-Linux-kernel" class="headerlink" title="The Linux kernel"></a>The Linux kernel</h2><p>The kernel is where all of the magic happens.  The kernel is the software that talks directly to your hardware, and does everything needed to keep your computer running.  The kernel runs at a low level known as Kernel Space.  Here the operating system manages its resources such as what programs have access to the CPU at what time, and allocating memory accordingly.  But this is all stuff to learn after you learn how to use the basic features of Linux.  You will never learn everything but that shouldn’t stop you from trying!!</p>

        <h1 id="So-Many-Choices"><a href="#So-Many-Choices" class="headerlink" title="So Many Choices!"></a>So Many Choices!</h1><h1 id="The-significance-of-Desktop-Environments"><a href="#The-significance-of-Desktop-Environments" class="headerlink" title="The significance of Desktop Environments"></a>The significance of Desktop Environments</h1><p>When ever you think of a PC or a MAC or almost any computer for that matter, you think of the mouse and keyboard, icons, buttons, pictures, and you pretty background.  Well it may suprise you to know that it hasn’t always been that way.  Way back when the internet was a barren waste land and virtually non-existant for the general public, there were no such thing as desktop environments and the only way for users to interact/talk to their computer was to learn a complicated computer language, which they used to type commands into the terminal.  There was no mouse, no buttons, no icons, and a usually black screen with a blinking cursor, to tell the use that the computer is ready to accept input.</p>
<h1 id="The-first-Desktop-Environments"><a href="#The-first-Desktop-Environments" class="headerlink" title="The first Desktop Environments"></a>The first Desktop Environments</h1><p>The first electronic computer came out around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Hardware" target="_blank" rel="external">1938 and was developed by the US navy to be used on board a submarine</a>.  It wasn’t until the 1970s, that the first desktop environment came out.  The very first desktop environment was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox" target="_blank" rel="external">Xerox</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto" target="_blank" rel="external">Xerox Alto</a> computer.  However it took another 14 years or so for the desktop environment to really catch on in the comsumer world when Macintosh adopted this style of computer interface; and later Microsoft followed suit.  Now UNIX whitch is what the Linux kernel is based off of also used a desktop environment.  This led to a race for the most user friendly and visually appealing Dektop Environment.</p>
<h1 id="Linux-desktops"><a href="#Linux-desktops" class="headerlink" title="Linux desktops"></a>Linux desktops</h1><p>Once desktop environments hit the mainstream consumer base, the number of people using computers increased dramatically, because the desktops made it easy for anyone to directly interact with their computer.  The linux operating system has many many different desktop environments available for user and distro developers to use with their linux distro.  We will talk about the most user friendly and popular environments, but first we will talk about the history of Desktop Environments in linux.</p>
<h1 id="The-start-of-Desktops-on-linux"><a href="#The-start-of-Desktops-on-linux" class="headerlink" title="The start of Desktops on linux"></a>The start of Desktops on linux</h1><p>Desktops in Linux run on something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" target="_blank" rel="external">X-window-system or X</a>.  This system runs on top of the linux shell.  On the most user friendly distros the X-server is executed automatically on boot, but on some of the more advanced distros used for servers and hacking systems the X-server must be started manually by the user.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" target="_blank" rel="external">X-window-system</a> was originally developed in 1984 at MIT and was implamented in the UNIX kernel.  Later it was implemented in the Linux kernel and is still in use as the main window manager.  However this could be short lived as the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol" target="_blank" rel="external">Wayland</a>) window management system is supposed to be taking over as the dominant window manager, but more about that later.</p>
<h2 id="Most-popular-Desktop-Environments"><a href="#Most-popular-Desktop-Environments" class="headerlink" title="Most popular Desktop Environments"></a>Most popular Desktop Environments</h2><h1 id="GNOME"><a href="#GNOME" class="headerlink" title="GNOME:"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME" target="_blank" rel="external">GNOME</a>:</h1><p><img src="images/gnome.png" alt="GNOME_IMG"></p>
<p>Probably one of the olest and most recognized of the Desktop Environments, GNOME was started in 1999 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_GNOME_Project" target="_blank" rel="external">The GNOME Project</a>, whitch was mostly made up of volunteer developers</p>
<h1 id="KDE-Plasma"><a href="#KDE-Plasma" class="headerlink" title="KDE Plasma"></a><a href="https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop" target="_blank" rel="external">KDE Plasma</a></h1><p><img src="images/kde.jpe" alt="KDE_img"></p>
<p>KDE is a very appealing desktop complete with nice and fluent animations, a Windows 7-like basic layout, and a full arsenal of built in tools.  Due to it’s familiar layout, KDE is a great desktop environment for beginners migrating from windows, however due to its animations and eyecandy it requires a good computer (nothing crazy though perhaps intel i3 and a good 4Gigs of RAM). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE#History" target="_blank" rel="external">KDE’s History</a></p>
<h1 id="MATE"><a href="#MATE" class="headerlink" title="MATE"></a><a href="http://mate-desktop.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">MATE</a></h1><p><img src="images/mate.png" alt="MATE_img"></p>
<p>MATE is actually an offshoot of GNOME.  MATE is also a Windows 7 type of desktop.  It has a nice menu, its great for beginners, and it is stable.  MATE ships with some custom MATE tools an uses a lot of GNOME software.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_(software" target="_blank" rel="external">MATE’S History</a>)</p>
<h1 id="Cinnamon-My-personal-favorite"><a href="#Cinnamon-My-personal-favorite" class="headerlink" title="Cinnamon (My personal favorite)"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_%28software%29" target="_blank" rel="external">Cinnamon (My personal favorite)</a></h1><p><img src="images/cinnamon.jpg" alt="Cinnamon_img"></p>
<p>Cinnamon is a nice happy medium between eye candy and stability.  Cinnamon is a fork of GNOME3 and has the stability of GNOME with the appeal of KDE.  Cinnamon was developed by the folks over at <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Linux Mint</a> an Ubuntu based distribution with its own package manager.  Linux Mint is another great distro for beginners from Windows 7.</p>
<h1 id="Unity"><a href="#Unity" class="headerlink" title="Unity"></a><a href="https://unity.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Unity</a></h1><p><img src="images/unity.png" alt="Unity_img"></p>
<p>Unity is yet another fork of GNOME.  Unity was developed by <a href="https://www.canonical.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cononical</a> specifically for their Linux distro <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Ubuntu</a>, which most Linux beginners start on Ubuntu or a subsidiary of Ubuntu.  So naturally this desktop is also very user friendly.</p>
<h1 id="XFCE"><a href="#XFCE" class="headerlink" title="XFCE"></a><a href="https://xfce.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">XFCE</a></h1><p><img src="images/xfce.png" alt="XFCE_img"></p>
<p>And last but not least, we have XFCE.  XFCE is one of those oldies but goodies, it is rather minimalistic so perhaps not for the absolute beginner.  XFCE is more MAC-like than anything as it features a navigation bar at eh bottom like a MAC but it is very basic.  This is great for those computer that are older and have out of date hardware.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce#History" target="_blank" rel="external">XFCE’s History</a></p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Now you should have a good grasp on what a Desktop Environment is and the different kinds that are available to you the Linux user.  Remember that the whole purpose of a Desktop Environment is to make computers more user friendly so most of them are, and most of them can be used by the average Joe. So get out there and experiment with different distros with different Desktops.  Or see what different Environments are supported by your distro of choice.  GOOD LUCK!!</p>

        <h2 id="Ubuntu-dropping-Unity"><a href="#Ubuntu-dropping-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Ubuntu dropping Unity??"></a>Ubuntu dropping Unity??</h2><p>  Ubuntu known as one of the most user friendly linux distros out there, has dropped it’s support for the unity desktop enviroment.<br>  They are supposed to be going back to the good ol GNOME interface for their upcomming releases.  Of course this will be a huge impact<br>  for those that started using Ubuntu while Unity was in use.  Of course those who came to Ubuntu way back when GNOME was again the<br>  main interface will feel right at home.  Of course these are the people happy about the change, but we all have to remember, this<br>  is Linux, for the user by the user.  So that means that those who like Unity will most likely easily be able to switch from the now<br>  default GNOME to Unity.</p>
<h2 id="What-will-happen-to-Unity-now"><a href="#What-will-happen-to-Unity-now" class="headerlink" title="What will happen to Unity now?"></a>What will happen to Unity now?</h2><p>  Now that unity will not be officially be supported by Cononical anymore its most likely that it will go on to be developed by the<br>  open source community.  I do believe that its a better way to go, I am really cuious to see how the Unity switch will go, I am also curious<br>  to see how to open-source community will develop Unity once its curbed.</p>
<h2 id="My-view"><a href="#My-view" class="headerlink" title="My view"></a>My view</h2><p>  Unity was a great environment for the normal user.  It was easy to learn, fluent, and just worked (most of the time), but of course<br>  GNOME is a time tested system that has been under constant development since 1997, and was first developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#History" target="_blank" rel="external">Miguel de        Icaza</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#History" target="_blank" rel="external">Federico Mena</a>.  And of course we all know that Unity was developed by Cononical for Ubuntu so its deffinatly going to be an interesting switch.</p>
